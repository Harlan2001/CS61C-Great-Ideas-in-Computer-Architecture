# CS 61C

The final course in the Berkeley CS61 series dives into the hardware details of computers, taking students step by step to understand how C language is converted into RISC-V assembly and executed on the CPU.Unlike Nand2Tetris, this course is much more difficult and in-depth, covering pipelining, Cache, virtual memory, and concurrency.

The Project of this course is also very novel and interesting.Project1 will let you write a small program in C, and the Fall semester of '20 is famous for Game of Life.Project2 will let you write a neural network in RISC-V assembly to recognize MNIST handwritten digits, which will greatly improve your understanding and use of assembly code.In Project3 you will use the Logisim digital circuit emulation software to build a secondary pipeline CPU and run RISC-V assembly code on it.Project4 will let you use OpenMP, SIMD, and other methods to optimize matrix operations in parallel to implement a simple Numpy.

All in all, this is the best computer architecture course anyone has ever taken.
