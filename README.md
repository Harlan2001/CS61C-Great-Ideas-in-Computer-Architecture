   ## CS61C : Great ideas in Computer architecture

This repository contains all my learning resources for CS61C. I use the 2020 summer version because it open-sourced the lecture videos. You can watch the videos either on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoI-XvXO0aqgoMQvogzmf7CKiSMSUS3M) or [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fC4y147iZ?from=search&seid=1039011700066128636).

Here is the [course website](https://cs61c.org/su20/), you can find all the materials on it.

repository structure is as follows :

- Handouts: some additional reading materials, including some openMP learning materials
- Slides: course slides
- Discussions: TA discussion pdf and answers

---

This course puts all its labs on a seperate repository. 

- Labs: contains 11 labs , I put it in an [independent repository](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/CS61C-labs)

  - [x] Lab01: C basics
  - [x] Lab02: Advanced C

  - [x] Lab03: RISC-V basics  
  - [x] Lab04: RISC-V functions
  - [x] Lab05: Logism
  - [x] Lab06: CPU & pipling
  - [x] Lab07: caches
  - [x] Lab08: virtual memory
  - [x] Lab09: SIMD
  - [x] Lab10: openMP
  - [x] Lab11: Spark

The projects I chose the 2020 fall version, which is a little different than the 2020 summer version. You can use the "Semesters" button on the up-right of the website page to choose the semester.

- Projects: I did five projects, each project is a independent repository, the links below will redirect to the repository which contains my implementation.

  - [x] Fa19-Project1: [Mandelbrot](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/Mandelbrot-Fractal-Zoomer)

  - [x] Fa20-Project1: [game-of-life](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/GameOfLife)
  - [x] Fa20-project2: [classify](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/NeuralNetwork-by-RISC-V)
  - [x] Fa20-project3: [CPU](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/RISC-V_CPU)
  - [ ] Fa20-project4: numc
